# Schess.
I made chess, in python, all from scratch. 

# Why?
They blocked chess.com in school, I had to improvise. Hush I know there's other chess websites, but where's the fun in that?

# To do:
- King piece
- Checking king / checkmating
- En passant rule
- Pawn promotion
- Proper interface using HTML / CSS / JS
- idk
